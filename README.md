# MoE Code challenge. May 2022. The Carousel Challenge.

## Dev Challenge: Round and around


tl;dr. Develop a unique take on the carousel component.


Using your technology of choice, develop a new take on the humble carousel.
Things to consider:
 * What type of content is to be carouseled??? ? Images, Videos, Audio, 3D farm animals, other?
 * How will the content transition? Swipe, Slide, Fade, Morph, transporter?
 * Will it be reusable? How will users interact with it? Is it accessible, mobile friendly, does it know how to 'partay'.
 * What tech will you use? Vue, jQuery, Pascal, Visual Basic or Bash.

We'll do a show and tell on the 3rd of June. Be prepared to present 1 example, and talk to these points.

 * Why did you go with this example?
 * What was difficult/easy?
 * What had you not considered before?

Have fun with it, get a bit crazy. Best example becomes the de-facto carousel for the design system :troll: . (shhh don't tell the designers)

## Running and Building

```
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


```
npm run build

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
